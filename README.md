# automated-court-booker

future improvements

1. have an option to combine bond and c. drive data together for the bot to book courts at both stadiums.
2. add optional start and/or end time for algorithm so it only books within certain time constraints - speeds up convergence time as well
3. credit balance checker - have 3 different statuses (correspond to the 3 different pricing tiers) - calculates and checks if my credit balance is sufficient for the booking request
